make-md
=======

This is a simple node module that creates a .md file then launches the newly created file.

The module accepts a single command-line parameter, the name of the file to create. If this parameter is omitted, `readme.md` is used.

Sample usage:

	make-md myfile.md

Creates a new file called `myfile.md` in the current directory, then launches the default editor for .md files, passing the newly created file to the editor.

	make-md 

Creates a new file called `readme.md` in the current directory, then launches the default editor for .md files, passing the newly created file to the editor.
